									Teaching and Learning in Early Years should be Play based as Carl Jung has said “The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct.”
								 </p>
								 <div class="nicdark_space10"></div> 
								 <p>
									 At Tic Tac Toe we believe that young children develop their senses through exploration and discovery. Our young learners use creative play to communicate their feelings which is so important. During creative play our young learners experience, discover, experiment and create things which ignite their curiosity and are the first steps into discovery learning. For us the process is more important than the product and this is imbibed in our learners from the early years.

								  <p>
									It is an important and integral part of our active playtime.
								 </p>
								 <div class="nicdark_space10"></div> 
								 <p>
									 At Tic Tac Toe we add physical activities as a part of our daily routine as it is important for our learner’s well-being e.g. climbing, playing on a jungle gym, jumping etc helps strengthen their muscles.
								 </p>
								 <div class="nicdark_space10"></div> 
								 <p>
									 We believe our young learners need a lot of different types of movement, so we engage them in simple yet fun engagements like Animal Walk, Puddle Jumping, Bubble Play to name a few. Physical activity strengthens children’s bones, muscles, hearts and lungs and enhances children’s coordination, balance, posture and flexibility.
								 </p>

							  <div class="nicdark_margin20" id="tabs-3">
								  <p>
									Positive social interactions are beneficial for young learners including increased cognitive ability, communication skills and independence.
								 </p>
								 <div class="nicdark_space10"></div>  
								 <p>
									 Interacting with friends at Tic Tac Toe gives our learners the chance to establish boundaries, note how others react to their actions and find ways to resolve conflicts amicably; all valuable skills that they will need in their future.
								 </p>
								 <div class="nicdark_space10"></div>

									  Children may be emotional for the first few days when they begin pre-school at Tic Tac Toe, but as the young learners settle into our pre-school routine, it boosts their confidence, independence and self-reliance.
								  </p>
								  <p>
									  They are slowly trained to manage simple tasks on their own which helps them go one step higher on their personal confidence ladder like wearing their shoes or learning to bounce a ball which builds self-esteem and gives a feeling of “<strong>I can surely do this</strong>”.
								  </p>
								  <p>
									  Tic Tac Toe provides an environment to encourage children without pushing too hard, providing the perfect safe space for them to grow.
								  </p>
							  </div>
							  <div class="nicdark_margin20" id="tabs-5">
								  <p>
									  Tic Tac Toe uses children’s natural tendency to play which includes free play or unstructured play along with structured play which is learner centred. We balance between play-based learning with educator-guided experiences for each child’s holistic development. Music and Movement is an integral part of our daily timetable.
								  </p>

									  We plan learning engagements using story-telling and field trips to nurture values, literacy, numeracy and respect for the environment.
