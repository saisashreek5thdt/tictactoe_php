Tic Tac Toe believes that positive fun filled learning experiences will lay the foundation for a self motivated life long learner. 
Our learning engagements are curated to ignite a passion for wonder, discovery, and experiential learning.
For us each child in our day care program is special and unique. Available for children 3 years to 10 years , 
each child in our Day Care program has specific needs and preferences so we adapt to your 
childâ€™s needs in consultation with you thus ensuring we offer a home away from home.
In daycare we give the young children plenty of time for play. Instead of trying to 
teach these young children new skills, we nurture them and support their natural learning through play . 
Older children will be supported to finish their school work and will be helped by trained educators to 
further their learning journey by engaging them in developing a love for reading , learn new sports in 
our sports grounds under a trained coach or practice creative writing to become young budding authors etc.
